Discovery of Metformin, effectively treating periodic paralysis

Documentation of the discovery of metformin's ability to treat periodic paralysis.

Diagnosed with periodic paralysis, shortly after, metformin hcl was able to decrease instances of periodic paralysis substantially. 

Avoiding salt, sugar, high glycemic carbohydrates and BCAA's also decreased instances of periodic paralysis substantially. 

Other findings, low estrogen (caused by aromatase inhibiters) increased periodic paralysis substantially, as well as beta 2 adrenergic agonists. Therefore one can hypothesize that beta blockers may also decrease instances of periodic paralysis, as well as normalizing estrogen and testosterone levels.

Unsure of mechanism, however, hypothesis is the effect of metformin's ability to increase insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels, thus decreasing instances of hypokalemia. This is also the hypothesized mechanism through which beta 2 adrenergic agonists and aromatase inhibiters increase instances of periodic paralysis, through increasing insulin levels. 

Spironolactone as well as hydrochlorothiazide were also effective in decreasing instances of periodic paralysis, almost completely. However possible cases of hyperkalemia may occur due to the rebound in potassium levels after a periodic paralysis episode.
